### Observations and Insights

#### Valerie Popovich - Analysis

The following data highlights tumor treatment of mice. There are 10 drugs in this trial, including one placebo. The total number of mice in this study is 248 after removing one mouse with inconclusive data. The gender of the mice is closely split at 51% male, and 49% female.

In a focus of four specific drugs, at least two drugs (Capomulin and Ramicane) show a notable reduction in tumor volume. Infubinol is the only drug to produce one outlier with noted reduction in tumor volume. The results show that the Capomulin drug treatment has the most significant tumor volume reduction.
